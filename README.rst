CS-330 Internet Programming
===========================


Getting your environment set up
-------------------------------

It is important that you are comfortable working from the command line in this class.  If you are not comfortable working from the command line, and using git, then I would recommend you check out the following:

* Codecademy: `Using the Command Line <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line>`_  Well worth a couple of hours.
* Codecademy: `Git Basics <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git>`_
* Tower: `Learn Version control with Git <https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook>`_ Is an excellent overview also.

Because we will be installing a lot of third party packages, and because a big part of web programming involves using and installing 3rd party packages you will each create your own installation of Ubuntu Linux.  This is a very common development environment as well as a common environment for deploying production ready web apps.

* Kent has written up a nice set of instructions for `installing Ubuntu <http://knuth.luther.edu/~leekent/stories/installing-linux-in-our-lab.html>`_



Unit 1 - Networking Basics
--------------------------

The goals of this first unit are to understand a bit about Network programming, as this forms the basis for how the web server and the browser communicate with each other.

* Week of February 7

    * Tuesday - Get Linux environments installed and configured

        * Configure Network for 'Bridged Mode' so we can access server
        * Test the echoServer3.py and echoclient3.py programs with a partner

    * Thursday - Look at Multithreading and Multi-process models of the echo server

        * See echoServerMT.py and echoServerMP.py
        * Demonstrate a simple python webserver
        * start to write our own webserver based on echoServerXX.py

* Week of February 14
