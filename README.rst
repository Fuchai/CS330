CS-330 Internet Programming
===========================


Getting your environment set up
-------------------------------

If you are not comfortable working from the command line, and using git, then I would recommend you check out the following:

* Codecademy: `Using the Command Line < https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line>`_  Well worth a couple of hours.
* Codecademy: `Git Basics < https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git>`_
* Tower: `Learn Version control with Git <https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook>`_ Is an excellent overview also.

Kent has written up a nice set of instructions for `installing Ubuntu <http://knuth.luther.edu/~leekent/stories/installing-linux-in-our-lab.html>`_

Unit 1 - Networking Basics
--------------------------

The goals of this first unit are to understand a bit about Network programming, as this forms the basis for how the web server and the browser communicate with each other.
