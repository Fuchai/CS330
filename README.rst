Getting your environment set up
-------------------------------

It is important that you are comfortable working from the command line in this class.  If you are not comfortable working from the command line, and using git, then I would recommend you check out the following:

* Codecademy: `Using the Command Line <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line>`_  Well worth a couple of hours.
* Codecademy: `Git Basics <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git>`_
* Tower: `Learn Version control with Git <https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook>`_ Is an excellent overview also.

Because we will be installing a lot of third party packages, and because a big part of web programming involves using and installing 3rd party packages you will each need your own installation of Ubuntu Linux.  This is a very common development environment as well as a common environment for deploying production ready web apps.

* Kent has written up a nice set of instructions for `installing Ubuntu <http://knuth.luther.edu/~leekent/stories/installing-linux-in-our-lab.html>`_  He also has a `video here <http://cs.luther.edu/~leekent/InstallingLinux.mp4>`_
