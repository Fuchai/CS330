Your final project must be written using the Flask application framework. It can be a project based around almost anything as long as it meets the following criteria in terms of the use of web2py.

### For a C
For a grade of a C you can create a blogging engine, by following the Miguel Grinberg Flask Tutorial.


### For a B
For a grade of a B your project must incorporate the following.

* You must have at least three controllers
* You must have at least three views
* You must make use of some persistent data - something must be stored and accessed from the database. Using SqlAlchemy or some other Python DB API.  No more than one table is required.
* Your program must use the bootstrap templates, and you must make an attempt to make it look aesthetically nice.

### For an A
To earn an A on the project you will need to go further.

* You must use the SqlAlchemy plugin and create a database with 3-4 tables.  These tables should incorporate a one to many relationship in some way, or they may have a many to many relationship.
* You should deploy your project on Heroku, appengine, or some other free hosting site so that it is freely accessable and not on the Luther network.
* You should incorporate the WTForms module into your application for processing form data.
* You should provide a small AJAX API for some aspect of the project that you use in your web pages.  Or you may incorporate some other more advanced Flask Plugin that you OK with me.
* Your program must use the bootstrap templates, and you must make an attempt to make it look aesthetically nice.

You may work in teams of 2 on this project.

This project will be due during finals week, we will set up an appointment for you to demonstrate and explain the project to me. In addition your project should be publicly available.
